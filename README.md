## Running testgary22 in Quarkus dev mode
You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
mvn compile quarkus:dev
```

## Testing with curl
First, validate the workflows exposed by the application:
```shell script
curl -v -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/management/processes
```
(testgary22 should be included in the returned array)

Then, assuming that you stored in [input.json](./input.json) the input parameters (if any) following the input schema specifications at
[testgary22-schema.json](./src/main/resources/schemas/testgary22-schema.json ), run the following to create an
instance of the testgary22 workflow:
```shell script
curl -v -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8080/testgary22 -d@input.json
```

# Dev UI Tools
Use the `Serverless Workflow Tools` to manage and monitor the published workflows:
```
http://localhost:8080/q/dev-v1/org.kie.kogito.kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow-devui/workflowInstances
```

Use the `Data Index GraphQL UI` to query the state of the [Data Index service](https://sonataflow.org/serverlessworkflow/main/data-index/data-index-core-concepts.html):
```
http://localhost:8080/q/dev-v1/org.kie.kogito.kogito-addons-quarkus-data-index-inmemory/dataindex
```
